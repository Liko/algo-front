[Algos](http://www.algos.life) is an algorithm visualizer built by Gee-Wey Yue, Gordy Lanza, and Li Xie using React.

## Motivation

- We were interested in exploring algorithms and their different sorting logic to learn about a complicated topic.
- We wanted to share our learnings with easy-to-follow visualization, so we used react-spring to animate the sorting steps and chose colors to showcase the sorting logic.
- We wanted to explore differences in algorithm performance based on array size, so we allow users to set the number of elements for sorting.

## Stack

- React.js
- Semantic UI for Styling
- react-spring for Animation
- Deployed through Netlify

## Features

- Users can add to or remove from displayed algorithm cards
- Users can set the number of elements for each new algorithm card
- Users can toggle play, pause, forward, back, and reset for all algorithm cards, either using the control panel or with keyboard options ("p" for play/pause, "right arrow" for forward, "left arrow" for back, "r" for reset)
- Users can set speed of sorting display
- Users can view the application on mobile
